# My DFIR CTF Toolkit

This Roadmap outlines the core tools for tackling Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. It includes a brief description of each tool and links to learning resources.

## Core DFIR Tools

### Disk and File System Analysis

* **Autopsy:** A powerful, open-source digital forensics platform with a graphical user interface. It allows for disk imaging, file system analysis, data carving, keyword searching, web artifact analysis, and more through a modular design.

    * **Learning Resources:**
        * [Autopsy Official Documentation](https://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.20/index.html)
        * [SANS Digital Forensics Blog - Autopsy](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/tag/autopsy)
        * [YouTube Tutorials (e.g., Justin Tolman's Forensic Analysis Series)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL94xJT4Vz5qIB-R9mu_M-A364B27h11YB)

### Memory Forensics

* **Volatility:** A robust open-source memory forensics framework written in Python. It enables the analysis of RAM dumps from various operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android) to extract information about running processes, network connections, loaded kernel modules, registry data, and more.

* **tcpdump**



### Log Analysis

* **grep (Global Regular Expression Print):** A powerful command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. Essential for quickly finding relevant information within log files.

    * **Learning Resources:**
        * [GNU grep Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html)
        * [Linux Command Line Basics Tutorials (focus on grep)](https://ryanstutorials.net/linux-tutorial/grep.php)
        * [Numerous online resources and cheat sheets for grep](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=grep+cheat+sheet&t=h_&ia=web)

### Basic Malware Analysis

* **PEStudio:** A free tool for the static analysis of Portable Executable (PE) files (Windows executables). It provides insights into imports, exports, sections, and indicators of potential malicious activity.

    * **Learning Resources:**
        * [PEStudio Official Website (no extensive documentation, but the tool is intuitive)](https://www.winitor.com/)
        * [Malware Analysis Tutorials often feature PEStudio](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pestudio+malware+analysis)

* **strings:** A simple command-line utility available on most operating systems that extracts human-readable strings from binary files. Useful for quickly identifying potential indicators, URLs, or embedded information.

    * **Learning Resources:**
        * [Man page for `strings` (in your terminal: `man strings`)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strings.1.html)
        * [Usage examples in various online tutorials on reverse engineering and malware analysis](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=strings+command+line+examples&t=h_&ia=web)

* **HxD (or any Hex Editor):** A hex editor allows you to view and edit the raw bytes of a file. Essential for understanding file formats, identifying anomalies, and sometimes extracting hidden data. HxD is a popular free option for Windows.

    * **Learning Resources:**
        * [HxD Website (minimal documentation, the tool is straightforward)](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
        * [Tutorials on basic hex editing concepts](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hex+editor+tutorial+basics)

## General CTF Skills and Tools that Aid DFIR

* **Python:** A versatile scripting language crucial for automating tasks, parsing data, and writing custom analysis scripts often needed in CTFs.

    * **Learning Resources:**
        * [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
        * [Codecademy Python Courses](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
        * [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (Free Book)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

* **Regular Expressions (Regex):** A powerful way to define search patterns for text. Essential for efficiently searching through logs, files, and network traffic for specific information.

    * **Learning Resources:**
        * [regexone.com](https://regexone.com/) (Interactive tutorial)
